## Code

The code was functional however it was poorly written. Not only did it communicate its sections very poorly, but it was difficult for another code to identify it parts.

- *HTML Before*

- *HTML Now*
The sections now have meaningful semantic names:

The Style Sheet has been improved as well:
- *CSS Before*
